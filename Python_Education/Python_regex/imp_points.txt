How we could use regex:
1. import the re module in python.
2. Use grep in linux command line.

### Using re module :-
1. search function - re.search(r"rawstring","wheretosearch") function returns match object with the index where
the raw string is located.

2. We can also use special characters for searching.

3. One can use re.IGNORECASE which ignores case sensitivity. 

4. Charater classes written in square brackets and anything inside it is used to search. 
For Ex: re.search(r"[Pp]ython", "python") --> searches for lower or upper case p python.

4(a). We can also use dash - charater to set a range of values.
ForEx: re.search(r"[a-z]way","highway") --> will accept charater from a to z before way i.e hway.

4(b). We can also combine ranges just like [a-zA-Z0-9]. 
Charaters which isnt in the string use [^followed by charaters or range].

4(c). To search for alternatives use pipe symbol '|' which uses OR logic. 
forEx: re.search(r"cat|dog", "cat")

4(d). Use findall which finds all characters in a list.

### Using Grep which is a linux regex command line.

1. '.' charater is used to represent any charater it is a wildcard.
For Ex: grep v.vi <--file location-->
will search all lines or strings matching with v(any charater)vi.

2. The -i means search is case independent(both upper and lower case).
For Ex: grep -i python <--file location-->
will search for python string independent of case.

3. ^-circumflex sign or start string and $-dollar sign is end string.
For Ex: grep ^python <--file location--> 
will search any string starting with python.

grep python$ <--file location--> 
will search any string ending with python.

4. ' . , ^ , $ ' are all special characters in grep.
